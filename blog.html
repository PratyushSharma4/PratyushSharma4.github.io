            <h3>The Flaw in the Casino Game Betting Strategy</h3>
            <div class="question">
                <strong>Question:</strong> What is the flaw in the casino game betting strategy of doubling your bet
                after every loss?
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <strong>Answer:</strong> The flaw lies in applying the linearity of expectation without recognizing
                that the betting strategy leads to an infinite series of bets that do not converge. While each
                game has a fair expectation of $0, the doubling strategy can lead to a situation where losses
                accumulate exponentially, potentially leading to financial ruin before a win occurs.
            </div>
            <p>
                Imagine a simple casino game with exactly a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing. The
                game sounds fair enough, but what if we decide to apply a particular betting strategy? Suppose I
                bet $1 and keep doubling my bet each time I lose until I eventually win. Assuming I have unlimited
                money, I would theoretically gain $1 as soon as I win the game. Since each game has an expectation
                of $0 due to the 50-50 win-loss split, it might seem like I should still walk away with a profit
                regardless of the expectation value being zero. So, where is the flaw in this reasoning?
            </p>

            <p>
                The mistake lies in applying the <em>linearity of expectation</em> to this situation without the
                necessary conditions. Linearity of expectation works when we have either a finite set of random
                variables or an infinite series of random variables that converge absolutely. In this casino game
                setup, however, we're dealing with an <strong>infinite series of bets</strong> that do not converge
                — precisely because we are doubling our bet each time we lose.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here's what happens: if I keep losing and doubling my bet indefinitely, the sum of my bets grows
                exponentially. Since I assume unlimited money, I am essentially betting an infinite amount over
                time, which fails the absolute convergence criterion needed for linearity of expectation. Without
                convergence, expectation cannot be applied as assumed, which invalidates the conclusion that I will
                walk away with profit.
            </p>

            <p>
                In reality, resources are always limited, and even with very large funds, the probability of a long
                string of losses remains. Such a losing streak could lead to financial ruin before a win occurs.
                Therefore, while each individual game has a fair expectation of $0, trying to apply this
                expectation over an infinite, non-converging series of bets creates a flaw in the logic and an
                unrealistic view of “guaranteed profit.”
