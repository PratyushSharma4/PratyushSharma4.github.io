                <h3>The Flaw in the Casino Game Betting Strategy</h3>
                <div class="question">
                    <strong>Question:</strong> Imagine a simple casino game with exactly a 50% chance of winning and a 50% chance of losing. The game sounds fair enough, but what if we decide to apply a particular betting strategy? Suppose I bet $1 and keep doubling my bet each time I lose until I eventually win. Assuming I have unlimited money, I would theoretically gain $1 as soon as I win the game. Since each game has an expectation of $0 due to the 50-50 win-loss split, it might seem like I should still walk away with a profit
                    regardless of the expectation value being zero. So, where is the flaw in this reasoning?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> The mistake lies in applying the <em>linearity of expectation</em> to this situation without the
                    necessary conditions. Linearity of expectation works when we have either a finite set of random
                    variables or an infinite series of random variables that converge absolutely. In this casino game
                    setup, however, we're dealing with an <strong>infinite series of bets</strong> that do not converge
                    â€” precisely because we are doubling our bet each time we lose.
