                <div class="question">
                    <strong>Question:</strong> A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the
                    execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. He will not know the day of the hanging until the executioner knocks on
                    his cell door (at almost noon) that day. Having reflected on his sentence, the prisoner draws the conclusion that he
                    will escape from the hanging. He begins by concluding that the “surprise hanging” can not be on Friday, as if he has not
                    been hanged by Thursday, there is only one day left - and so it will not be a surprise if he is hanged on Friday. Since the
                    judge’s sentence stipulated that the hanging would be a surprise to him, he concludes it cannot occur on Friday. He then
                    reasons that the surprise hanging cannot be on Thursday either, because Friday has already been eliminated and if he
                    has not been hanged by Wednesday noon, the hanging must occur on Thursday, making a Thursday hanging not a surprise
                    either. By similar reasoning he concludes that the hanging can also not occur on Wednesday, Tuesday, or Monday. Joyfully
                    he retires to his cell confident that the hanging will not occur at all. The next week, the executioner knocks on the
                    prisoner’s door at noon on Wednesday which, despite all the above, was an utter surprise to him. What the judge said
                    came true. What was the flaw in his logic?
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> The very first step in his reasoning that he cannot be hanged on the last day is wrong. There is a contradiction as
                    given. If his prediction was correct, we deduce that he is hanged on a Friday. But if he is hanged on a Friday, his
                    prediction is falsified. If his prediction is false, you are left without a logical reasoning for deducing the hanging
                    date. And if you cannot deduce the date of the hanging his prediction will certainly be confirmed. Even after living
                    till Thursday the question of whether you can "deduce" that you will be hanged tomorrow has no unambiguous answer. If
                    you accept only answer that you will be hanged, then of course not being hanged on a Friday can be deduced. In that
                    case, it is an expected hanging and the assertion that it would not be is proved false. As O'Beirne makes clear, the key
                    to resolving the paradox lies in recognizing that a statement about a future event can be known to be a true prediction
                    by one person but not known to be true by another until after the event. It is easy to think of simple examples. Someone
                    hands you a box and says: "Open it and you will find an egg inside." He knows that his prediction is sound, but you do
                    not know it until you open the box. The same is true in the paradox. The judge knows that his prediction is sound. But
                    the prediction cannot be used to support a chain of arguments that results eventually in discrediting the prediction
                    itself.
